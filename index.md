## Adam Altounyan

I'm a seasoned IT, Infrastructure and Information Security professional available for Contracts, part-time, voluntary and advisory roles where my experience can make an impact. I've run Information Security departments for the past 7 years working across many domains and areas of knowledge. I'm very familiar with GDPR and related UK Data Protection regulations, and can provide business-savvy advice here. Prior to InfoSec, i built large scale private infrastructure in the Finance world, architecting and building secure systems responsible for moving $30 Billion of foreign exchange annually. 

I fill an industry gap in having both technical and communication skills, where I'm at ease communicating with both your engineers or your senior execs.
